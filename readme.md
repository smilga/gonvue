# gonvue
Spent too much time to create boilerplate code for some small projects that uses GO and Vue.
So there goes template.

## Getting Started
Install frontend dependencies
```
cd frontend
npm install
```
There are two shell scripts to make it simple
### Development
To start go web server and webpack dev server both with live realod
```
./dev.sh
```
### Production
Production version will be under './build' folder
```
./prod.sh
```
